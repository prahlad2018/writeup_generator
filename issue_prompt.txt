PIM# - PIM-153273
Issue Description : In Release 29, users observed an issue where navigating between the income and summary pages triggered a null pointer exception (NPE). This occurred when an optional flag related to income eligibility was not set correctly.

Expected system behavior: users should not face an issue where navigating between the income and summary pages and system triggered a null pointer exception 
Current system behavior: users is facing an issue where navigating between the income and summary pages and system triggered a null pointer exception 
root cause: A null check was missing in the backend Spring Boot service that updates income summary flags. The code incorrectly assumed the flag would always be initialized, resulting in a runtime exception.
RCA Validation:Code review confirmed the absence of the null check. A test environment replication using a specific member RefId (9990012345) successfully reproduced the error. Logs validated this RefId triggered the exception.
